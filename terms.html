                <p>YOU HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE ALL LAWS THAT MAY LIMIT THE EFFICACY OF SUCH RELEASES.

                <p>This Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. The parties agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to the Agreement, its interpretation, performance, or breach, that are not resolved by informal negotiation within thirty (30) days (or any mutually agreed extension of time), shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in New York. Either party may commence the arbitration process called for herein by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The costs of arbitration plus reasonable attorneys’ fees (including fees for the value of services provided by in house counsel) shall be awarded to the prevailing party in such arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in the State or Federal Courts located in the State of New York. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be subject to arbitration and may be adjudicated only in the State or Federal Courts located in the State of New York: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim relating to or contesting the validity of Company’s proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, or trade secrets; or, (ii) an action by a party for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief.</p>

                <p><strong>RIGHT TO OPT OUT</strong> – If you do not wish to be bound by this arbitration clause, you must notify the Company in writing within 60 days after signing this Agreement or your rejection of arbitration will not be effective. You must send your request via our <a href="/contact-us/">Contact Us</a> form. Your request must include your telephone number(s) and a clear statement of your intent, such as "I reject the arbitration clause stated in the Company’s Website Terms of Use."</p>

                <p><strong>20. WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY OF TERMS.</strong></p>

                <p>The failure by Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect.</p>

                <p><strong>21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.</strong></p>

                <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Company and governs your use of the Website and Service, superseding any prior agreements.

                <p><strong>We Are Not Lenders or Brokers.</strong>The owner and operator of this website is not a lender, broker, agent, or representative of any lender and we do not provide any loans or make any credit decisions. The advertising contained on this website does not constitute an offer or solicitation to extend credit or lend money to you. This website provides a service wherein we collect information you voluntarily provide to us and we submit it to our independent network of companies, which includes lenders, who may be able to secure a loan for you. All financial terms and conditions of a loan will be presented to you by the lender. Any questions, concerns, or requests for more details on your loan should be directed to the lender and not to the owner and operator of this website. Typically lenders will not perform a credit check using the three major credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Equifax, or Trans Union, but they may obtain consumer credit reports from alternative providers.</p>

                <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> Not all lenders will offer up to $10,000 on your first installment loan. This may depend on the laws and regulations of the State in which you reside along with the information you provide to us for the lender's review or on other factors that the lender may obtain through a consumer credit report. Providing your information to this website will not guarantee you may be approved for an installment loan. Refinancing may be available and is typically not automatic. Refinancing your loan will extend the term of the loan and may result in additional interest charges. Failing to make any scheduled loan payment may result in additional interest charges and fees and may damage your credit. You should endeavor to repay your loan on time and in full to avoid any extra charges, damage to your credit, or being subject to debt collections. The services of this website are not available in all sates and the states serviced by this website may change from time to time and without notice. This service does not constitute an offer or solicitation for an installment loan where prohibited by law.</p>
