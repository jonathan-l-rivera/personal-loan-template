					<h2>Just follow these easy steps</h2> 
					<h3 class="sub-title">&amp; get the personal loan you need fast and easy:</h3>

<h4>Fill out the short Form</h4>
<p>Fill out the short loan request form on our website, including your credit type, how much you’d like to borrow, and your loan reason. The form will also ask for some basic personal, banking, and income information which will be used to help us determine what type of loan products  you could be eligible for.</p>

<h4>Agree to the Terms</h4>
<p>Once we receive your loan request we’ll reach out to our lender network and each lender will decide whether to approve your loan request or not based on the information you’ve provided. If you’re approved you’ll be sent to the lender’s loan agreement where the lender will show you’re the terms and conditions for your loan including the amount you’re approved for and the repayment terms and the interest rate. Make sure you read these terms thoroughly and if you have any questions reach out to the lender and they’ll be happy to explain the terms to you.</p>

<h4>Your Funds are Direct Deposited into Your Account</h4>
<p>After you’ve selected a lender, reviewed the terms of your personal loan, and accepted the loan your lender will transfer the funds directly to your bank account. The amount of time it takes for the funds to reach your account depends on the time of your loan approval, the lender you work with, and your bank but for most consumers you will receive your money between one to five business days after you accept the loan.</p>

			<h3>Personal Loan Requirements</h3>
			<p>At [website] we pride ourselves on our ability to match consumers of all credit types with a lender who can help them obtain a personal loan. While we accept requests for loans from consumers with any credit score, there are a few basic requirements you must meet to qualify for a loan from one of our partners. Before you request a personal loan make sure you meet the following criteria:</p>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col col--1-2"><p><strong>Age/ID/Residency</strong> - In order to obtain a personal loan you must be 18 years old or older, with a valid Social Security Number, and a legal U.S. citizen or permanent resident.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col col--1-2">
				<p><strong>Income</strong> - To ensure your ability to repay a loan you must be either full-time employed or self-employed, receive regular disability, or Social Security benefit to qualify for a loan. Some lenders may require a pay stub or another form of income verification.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col col--1-2">
				<p><strong>Bank Account</strong> - Most lenders in our network require a valid checking account that the funds from your loan can be transferred into. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col col--1-2">
				<p><strong>Credit Type</strong> - While you do not need perfect, or even good credit to qualify for a personal loan most lenders require that customers have demonstrated a pattern of responsibility. To be eligible for a personal loan a typical consumer must not have any accounts more than 60 days late; must not have active or recent bankruptcies; must not exhibit a history of late payments; must not have any debt that cannot be covered by current income; and must not have any recently charged-off accounts.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<p>While we cannot guarantee you will be approved for a personal loan through a lender we match you with, meeting the requirements above will greatly improve your chances of obtaining a personal loan. </p>
