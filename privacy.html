If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our Site.

You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and functionality of Company’s websites, you need to accept cookies.</p>

                <p><u>We predominately use “session” cookies, which are not permanently stored on your hard drive</u>. Session cookies expire after two hours of inactivity or when you close your browser. When you carry out the purchase of a service or product on our website, a large amount of data is processed by our system and transferred through each page of the search or registration. This information includes all information you input on a registration page or questionnaire you complete as part of the registration process as well as demographic information that is not unique to you. “Session” cookies allow us to keep track of this data until you have completed your search or registration.</p>

                <p><u>Removing Cookies</u>: You have the ability to accept, decline or move cookies at any time by modifying your browser settings. Please see http://cookiecentral.com. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the web site.</p>

                <p><u>Web Beacons</u>: We also use electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain information about your visit to these Web pages (including the number of users who have visited those pages), measure and improve the effectiveness of advertisements, and deliver services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about web site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with one or more third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Web pages, how those visitors use those Web Pages, and the effectiveness of their advertisements. WE may also use web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in our database.</p>

                <p><u>Disabling Web Beacons</u>: Because Web beacons are the same as any other content request, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.</p>

                <p><u>JavaScript</u>: We may also use JavaScript within certain advertisements. JavaScript is a computer language that enhances the functionality of websites, particularly in respect to pictures. We do not collecting any personal data via JavaScript but use it to analyze and improve the site’s functions.</p>

                <p><u>IP Addresses</u>: We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers, collecting information about a user’s traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.</p>

                <p><u>Computer Profiles</u>: Company may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, Company may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Identification Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you.</p>

                <p><u>Email and Unsubscribe Policy</u>: We may provide your personal information to third parties for promotional offers by email.

If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all Company’s email lists, a person must unsubscribe <a href="/unsub/">here</a>.</p>

                <p><u>Content of Email Messages</u>: You may receive certain commercial email messages sent by third parties for products which may be of interest to you.

                <p><u>Opting Out of Email Marketing Material</u>: We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when it asks for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference by emailing or calling us per the information contained on our contact page.</p>

                <p>If you no longer wish to receive our promotions, you may opt-out of receiving it by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by unsubscribing <a href="/unsub/">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Telemarketing: We may use your Personal Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones. You may have your telephone number or cell phone number listed on a state or federal do not call registry. By registering and using this Site, you agree that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq.

Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through the Website or other advertisement media made available by us (e.g., email marketing), you agree that such action shall constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted via email, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with the ATSR. We may use Personal Information to provide the services you’ve requested, including services that display customized content and advertising.</p>

                <p><b>SECURITY</b></p>

                <p>We endeavor to safeguard and protect your information. When you submit information at the website, such information is protected both online and offline. The servers in which we store Personal Information are kept in a secure physical environment. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. Currently, We use Secure Socket Layer Software (“SSL”) to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although We take commercially reasonable technological precautions to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, We cannot and do not warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through this site is at your own risk. However, access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public.</p>

                <p><b>CHANGES TO PRIVACY STATEMENT</b></p>

                <p>We reserve the right to make material changes to the substance of this Privacy Statement. We will post those changes through a prominent notice on the web site so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it.</p>

                <p><b>YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS</b></p>

                <p>A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.</p>

                <p>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.</p>

                <p>As stated in this policy, you have agreed to allow us to share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes until you remove your information and thus, agreement for such disclosure. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites or contact us via email to remove your information from our database. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</p>

                <p><strong>We Are Not Lenders or Brokers.</strong>The owner and operator of this website is not a lender, broker, agent, or representative of any lender and we do not provide any loans or make any credit decisions. The advertising contained on this website does not constitute an offer or solicitation to extend credit or lend money to you. This website provides a service wherein we collect information you voluntarily provide to us and we submit it to our independent network of companies, which includes lenders, who may be able to secure a loan for you. All financial terms and conditions of a loan will be presented to you by the lender. Any questions, concerns, or requests for more details on your loan should be directed to the lender and not to the owner and operator of this website. Typically lenders will not perform a credit check using the three major credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Equifax, or Trans Union, but they may obtain consumer credit reports from alternative providers.</p>

                <p><strong>Limitations.</strong> Not all lenders will offer up to $10,000 on your first installment loan. This may depend on the laws and regulations of the State in which you reside along with the information you provide to us for the lender's review or on other factors that the lender may obtain through a consumer credit report. Providing your information to this website will not guarantee you may be approved for an installment loan. Refinancing may be available and is typically not automatic. Refinancing your loan will extend the term of the loan and may result in additional interest charges. Failing to make any scheduled loan payment may result in additional interest charges and fees and may damage your credit. You should endeavor to repay your loan on time and in full to avoid any extra charges, damage to your credit, or being subject to debt collections. The services of this website are not available in all sates and the states serviced by this website may change from time to time and without notice. This service does not constitute an offer or solicitation for an installment loan where prohibited by law.</p>

                <p><strong>No Endorsement.</strong> The operator of this website is a marketer who is compensated for their services as described in our <a class="js-modal" href="#marketing-disclosure">marketing disclosure</a> and does not endorse or recommend any service or product advertised on or through this site.</p>
